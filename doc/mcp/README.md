# Modern Context Protocol (MCP)

### Overview

The Modern Context Protocol (MCP) is a foundational layer within `logLLM` designed to standardize the creation, management, and exchange of rich, structured information between different system components. It moves beyond simple data passing to create a semantically aware fabric that enables more intelligent and interconnected operations.

### Goals of MCP

- **Richer LLM Interactions**: Provide LLMs with more nuanced and comprehensive context (e.g., structured log data, agent states, tool outputs) to improve the quality of generated insights, summaries, and suggestions.
- **Improved Agent Interoperability**: Standardize how agents and utilities share information, reducing boilerplate conversion code and making it easier to build complex, multi-step workflows.
- **Enhanced Observability**: A clear, structured context protocol makes it easier to trace data flow and debug the state of the system at any point.
- **Foundation for Advanced Features**: Pave the way for future capabilities like dynamic tool use by LLMs, sophisticated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and proactive analysis based on contextual events.

### Core Components

1.  **[Schemas (`schemas.md`)](./schemas.md)**: A set of Pydantic models that define the core data structures of the protocol, including `ContextItem`, `ContextPayload`, `MCPToolDefinition`, and more.

2.  **[Context Manager (`mcp_manager.md`)](./mcp_manager.md)**: A utility class (`ContextManager`) for easily creating and assembling context items into a `ContextPayload`.

3.  **[Tool Registry (`tool_registry.md`)](./tool_registry.md)**: A simple but powerful registry (`ToolRegistry`) for defining, discovering, and invoking tools that can be used by agents or LLMs.
