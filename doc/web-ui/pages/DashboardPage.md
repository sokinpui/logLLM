# Dashboard Page (`DashboardPage.tsx`)

## File: `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

### Overview

The `DashboardPage` component serves as the main landing page or home screen for the `logLLM` application after a user logs in or navigates to the root URL (`/`).

### Purpose

- To provide users with a high-level overview of the system's status or key log analysis metrics.
- To act as a central point from which users can navigate to other features of the application.

### Current Implementation

As of the provided code, the `DashboardPage` is a placeholder component.

- It displays a title "Dashboard".
- It shows a welcome message indicating that this area will display key metrics and summaries in the future.

### Structure

- **Imports**:
  - `React` from 'react'.
  - `Typography` and `Paper` from `@mui/material` for basic styling and text display.
- **Rendering**:
  - A `Paper` component acts as a container with some padding.
  - A `Typography` component with `variant="h4"` displays the "Dashboard" title.
  - Another `Typography` component with `variant="body1"` displays the placeholder message.

### Future Enhancements (TODO)

- Integrate with backend services to fetch and display actual dashboard data. This could include:
  - Number of log groups.
  - Total logs collected.
  - Status of backend services (e.g., Elasticsearch, Kibana).
  - Recent error summaries.
  - Charts or graphs visualizing log activity or error trends.
- Add links or quick actions to navigate to frequently used sections of the application.
