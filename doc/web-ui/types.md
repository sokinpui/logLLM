# Frontend TypeScript Types

The `frontend/src/types/` directory contains TypeScript interface and type definitions used throughout the `logLLM` frontend application. These types play a crucial role in ensuring data consistency and improving developer experience by providing static type checking.

Many of these types are designed to mirror the Pydantic models used in the backend FastAPI application, facilitating seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend.

## Overview of Key Type Files

- **`types/api.ts`**:

  - Defines common API response structures like `MessageResponse`.
  - Includes types related to container management, such as `ContainerDetailItem`, `VolumeDetailItem`, `ContainerStatusResponse`, and `ContainerStopRequest`.
  - Defines a generic `ApiError` interface to represent error responses from the backend.

- **`types/collect.ts`**:

  - `GroupInfo`: Basic information about a log group (name, file count).
  - `DirectoryAnalysisResponse`: Structure for the response when analyzing a server directory path.
  - `TaskStatusResponse`: Specifically for collection tasks, including an optional `collection_summary` field.
  - `CollectionSummary`, `GroupCollectionSummary`: Detailed summary of a collection task's results.

- **`types/group.ts`**:

  - `GroupInfoDetail`: Detailed information for a single group, often used in listings.
  - `GroupInfoListResponse`: Structure for API responses listing multiple groups.

- **`types/staticGrokParse.ts`** (Implied by `staticGrokParseService.ts` type definitions):

  - `StaticGrokRunRequest`: Parameters for initiating a static Grok parsing run.
  - `StaticGrokTaskInfo`: Response after initiating a task.
  - `StaticGrokTaskStatus`: Detailed status of a parsing task, including `result_summary`.
  - `StaticGrokParseStatusItem`: Information about the parsing status of a single log file.
  - `StaticGrokStatusListResponse`: Response for listing multiple file parsing statuses.
  - `StaticGrokDeleteRequest`: Parameters for deleting parsed data.

- **`types/normalizeTs.ts`**:

  - `NormalizeTsRunRequest`: Parameters for initiating a timestamp normalization or deletion task.
  - `NormalizeTsTaskGroupResult`: The result of processing a single group during a normalization/deletion task.
  - `NormalizeTsTaskStatusResponse`: Detailed status of a normalization/deletion task, including `result_summary` which maps group names to their `NormalizeTsTaskGroupResult`.

- **`types/analyzeErrors.ts`**:
  - `AnalyzeErrorsRunParams`: Parameters for initiating an error summarization run.
  - `LogClusterSummaryOutput`: The structured summary generated by the LLM for a cluster of errors.
  - `ProcessedClusterDetail`: Detailed information about a single processed error cluster, including its `LogClusterSummaryOutput`.
  - `AnalysisResultSummary`: The overall summary of an error analysis run, containing details for all processed clusters.
  - `AnalyzeErrorsTaskStatusResponse`: Detailed status of an error analysis task, including `result_summary` (of type `AnalysisResultSummary`).
  - `TaskInitiationResponse`: Response after initiating an analysis task.
  - `ErrorSummaryListItem`: Structure for displaying a single error summary in a list.
  - `ListErrorSummariesResponse`: Response for listing multiple error summaries with pagination info.

## Purpose

- **Type Safety**: Helps catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
- **API Contract**: Clearly defines the expected shape of data exchanged with the backend.
- **Developer Experience**: Provides autocompletion and better understanding of data structures within the IDE.
- **Maintainability**: Makes the codebase easier to understand and refactor.

When the backend API models change, these frontend types should be updated accordingly to maintain consistency.
